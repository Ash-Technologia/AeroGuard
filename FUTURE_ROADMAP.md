# 🚀 AeroGuard: Future Roadmap & Enhancements

## 📅 Phase 1: Immediate Post-Hackathon (Next 2-4 Weeks)
*   **Real-Time IoT Integration**: Replace mock data with live streams from hardware sensors (ESP32 / Arduino with MQ-135 & PMS5003).
*   **Geolocation API**: Auto-detect user location using browser Geolocation API instead of manual dropdown selection.
*   **PWA Support**: Convert the web app to a Progressive Web App (PWA) so users can install it on their phones without an app store.

## 📅 Phase 2: Short Term (1-3 Months)
*   **User Accounts & History**:
    *   Save "Favorite Locations" (Home, Work, School).
    *   Track historical exposure to pollution for logged-in users.
*   **Smart Alerts system**:
    *   Email/SMS notifications when AQI exceeds specific health thresholds suitable for the user's profile (e.g., Asthma alert > 100 AQI).
*   **Community Reporting**:
    *   "Crowdsourced Smog Reports": Allow users to upload photos or report burning waste/smoke in their area to validate sensor data.

## 📅 Phase 3: Mid Term (3-6 Months)
*   **Wearable Health Integration**:
    *   Sync with Apple Health / Google Fit.
    *   Correlate high heart rate or asthma attacks with local AQI spikes.
*   **Advanced AI Models**:
    *   Switch to **Transformer-based models (TimeGPT)** for even longer forecast horizons (24-48 hours).
    *   Integrate Satellite Imagery Analysis (CNNs) to detect large-scale smoke plumes (stubble burning).

## 📅 Phase 4: Long Term (6+ Months)
*   **Hardware Ecosystem**:
    *   Launch proprietary "AeroGuard Home" sensor nodes that contribute to a decentralized community grid.
*   **B2B Dashboard**:
    *   API services for Real Estate platforms (showing "Clean Air Scores" for neighborhoods).
    *   Route optimization SDK for logistics companies to avoid high-pollution zones.
*   **Gamification**:
    *   "Clean Commute Challenge": Reward users points for walking/cycling on low-AQI days or choosing green transport.

## 🔮 Moonshot Goal
*   **"The Waze for Air"**: A fully decentralized, community-driven air quality map where every phone and every sensor acts as a node to fight the invisible killer.
